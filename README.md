## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about rem measurement
```css
.qr-code {
  width: 17rem;
}
```

I also learned how to center a div horizontally and vertically
```css
.qr-code-center {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to perfect my responsive techniques

### Useful resources

- [Center Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-vertical-align-how-to-center-a-div-text-or-an-image-example-code/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center elements on a page. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
